GroundControl
======================



##Overview

Ground Control is the program which allows you to control the Maslow machine.

From within Ground Control, you can move the machine to where you want to begin a cut,
 calibrate the machine, open and run a g-code file, or monitor the progress of an ongoing
 cut.

 At present, the UI looks like this:

Ground Control is written in the python programing language. Python was chosen because it
is a language with good cross platform support and is relatively simple to start working with.
Two of the goals of Ground Control are that it run on as many platforms as possible, and 
that it is as easy as possible for members of the community to contribute to making the 
program better.
